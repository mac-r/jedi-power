# Jedi Power

This is the rep of Jedi Power. I wrote this online game in a couple of hours as a way to entertain myself while writing a research paper on stochastic modelling.

That was the 2nd day of May 2012, when I wrote a letter to each student of Graduate School of Management, where I was studying at that time.

The letter was the following:

>Dear Friends!

>It's a well known fact that May is a very intensive and hard month in the life of GSOM undergraduates and masters. That's why I'd like to gift you with a small present which should cheer you up!

>**Legend**

>The Jedi are major characters in the Star Wars universe. The Jedi use a power called the Force, which emit a controlled energy flow in order to serve and protect the Galactic Republic and the galaxy at large from conflict or governmental instability.The best of Human being can have not more than 47% of this universal energy. There are only 0,09% of such people in the Solar System.

>Now you've got a chance to check if you are one of them!

>**Gameplay**

>You will see the icon of Master Yoda in the middle of the screen on the left. When you hold the icon, asteroids get activated and you should keep Yoda untouched with them as long as you can. Special algorithms estimate your Jedi Power during this process. Try to do your best! :)

>The source of my inspiration was NASA pilots reaction assessment test. Deterministic behaviour of asteroids was modified. You'll never meet the same scenario during the round. Thus the game gets really challenging and exciting!

>If you liked it, please spread a good word about it. Your advice and critics are highly appreciated as well.
>Best wishes!

That was my first attempt to make a viral app. Total page views reached 15 000 in four days. That's not much, really. I believe that if there were better tools to proove achievements the virality rate could be higher.
